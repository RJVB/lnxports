description         a small module used to disable the client side decoration of Gtk+3

long_description    Since Gtk+ 3.10, its developers added a so-called header bar or custom title bar. \
                    With this and the client-side decoration, the original title bar and window border \
                    provided by the window manager are disabled by Gtk+. This makes all Gtk+ 3 programs \
                    look alike. Even worse, this may break some window manager or compositors. \
                    Unfortunately, the Gtk+ developers decided to be against the existing standards \
                    and provide "no option" to turn it off. \
                    Luckily, with gtk3-nocsd, we still have a way to (partially) turn it off. Window manager \
                    (title bar and window border) can be re-enabled.
